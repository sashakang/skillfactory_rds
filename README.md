Final test on PROJECT-1

Quiz points: 27


1. My role in the team: SOLE.
2. Optimization of the algorithm on question #27: most frequent pair of actors.
3. Still missing some basic technics, like checking whether the key is in the dict and acting upon this condition output.
Also need more practice on basic operations with series, lists, dicts, dataframes.
4. One technic to make a list of unique values was particularly useful.
5. Ready to rock! After Unit-1 I grew confident in my ability to get through this course quickly, in a matter of 1-2 months.
6. The learning strategy I use proved to be working: dive head on, full immersion.
